Daniel Oltean, Digitising Greek texts: Named entity recognition in graph-based database models

===========================================================

This project focuses on extracting useful information from ancient Greek texts and linking them as structures that allow both open access and interoperability. The primary material of investigation are people, places, and events, extracted with Recogito. The tabular files are explored in a graph-based environment using Neo4j, queried with Cypher procedures, and linked with similar stable entities already existing on the web (Wikidata).
